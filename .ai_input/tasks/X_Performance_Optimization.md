# Task X: Performance Optimization

## Description
Audit slow paths (e.g. iptables calls), cache metadata lookups, debounce UI polling.

## Steps
1. Profile backend performance
   - Identify slow API endpoints
   - Analyze system call performance
   - Measure database/storage access times
   - Document performance bottlenecks

2. Implement backend optimizations
   - Add caching for metadata lookups
   - Optimize iptables and WireGuard command execution
   - Implement batching for frequent operations
   - Reduce database/storage access where possible

3. Profile frontend performance
   - Analyze component render times
   - Measure API call frequency and response times
   - Identify UI bottlenecks
   - Document frontend performance issues

4. Implement frontend optimizations
   - Add debouncing for frequent operations
   - Implement memoization for expensive calculations
   - Optimize component rendering
   - Reduce unnecessary API calls

## Human Verification Checkpoints
- [ ] Backend performance metrics are collected and analyzed
- [ ] Slow operations are identified and optimized
- [ ] Frontend performance is profiled
- [ ] UI polling is properly debounced
- [ ] Test performance improvements:
  - [ ] Measure API response times before and after
  - [ ] Compare UI responsiveness before and after
  - [ ] Verify reduced system resource usage
  - [ ] Check that functionality remains correct

## Dependencies
- All other tasks should be mostly complete

## Estimated Time
- 3-4 hours
