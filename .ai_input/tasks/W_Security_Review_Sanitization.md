# Task W: Security Review & Sanitization

## Description
Audit all inputs (subnet strings, file uploads) against injection; ensure subprocess calls are safe.

## Steps
1. Conduct input validation review
   - Audit all API endpoints for proper input validation
   - Review subnet string handling for injection vulnerabilities
   - Analyze file upload validation and sanitization
   - Verify all user inputs are properly sanitized

2. Review subprocess security
   - Audit all subprocess calls for command injection risks
   - Implement secure parameter passing
   - Review permission handling for system calls
   - Verify proper error handling for system operations

3. Perform static code analysis
   - Run automated security scanning tools
   - Address identified vulnerabilities
   - Document security measures implemented
   - Create remediation plan for any remaining issues

4. Implement security enhancements
   - Add input sanitization where needed
   - Improve subprocess call security
   - Enhance error handling to prevent information disclosure
   - Implement additional validation layers if required

## Human Verification Checkpoints
- [ ] All user inputs are properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] Subprocess calls are secure against command injection
- [ ] Static analysis tools show no critical security issues
- [ ] Security enhancements are implemented
- [ ] Test with attack scenarios:
  - [ ] Attempt command injection in subnet input
  - [ ] Try to upload malformed .conf files
  - [ ] Test with unexpected input formats
  - [ ] Verify system calls are properly secured

## Dependencies
- Tasks D-N (Backend components must be implemented)
- Tasks O-T (Frontend components must be implemented)

## Estimated Time
- 3-4 hours
