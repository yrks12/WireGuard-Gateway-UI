# Task V: Component Tests (Frontend)

## Description
Use Jest/Testing Library to cover upload form, dashboard, detail view, API error states.

## Steps
1. Set up frontend testing framework
   - Configure Jest and Testing Library
   - Create test utilities and helpers
   - Set up mock API services
   - Implement test fixtures for component data

2. Write component tests
   - Create tests for upload form functionality
   - Implement dashboard component tests
   - Add client detail view tests
   - Create tests for activation/deactivation controls

3. Implement integration tests
   - Create tests for component interactions
   - Implement API integration tests with mocks
   - Add routing/navigation tests
   - Create tests for state management

4. Add error state tests
   - Implement tests for API error handling
   - Create tests for form validation errors
   - Add tests for network failure scenarios
   - Implement tests for edge cases

## Human Verification Checkpoints
- [ ] Test suite runs successfully with Jest
- [ ] Component tests verify UI functionality
- [ ] Integration tests verify component interactions
- [ ] Error state tests confirm proper error handling
- [ ] All tests pass in CI environment
- [ ] Test with deliberate errors:
  - [ ] Break a component, verify test fails
  - [ ] Fix component, verify test passes

## Dependencies
- Tasks O-T (All frontend components must be implemented)

## Estimated Time
- 4-5 hours
