   - Configure Python environment in CI

## Human Verification Checkpoints
- [ ] Git repository is initialized and .gitignore is properly configured
- [ ] Branching strategy is established and documented
- [ ] CI pipeline successfully runs on commits:
  - [ ] Linting passes
  - [ ] Tests pass
  - [ ] Build completes successfully

## Dependencies
- None, this is the first task

## Estimated Time
- 2-3 hours
