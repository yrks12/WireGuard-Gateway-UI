# Task C: Scaffold Backend Framework

## Description
Set up Flask (or FastAPI) app with routing, request parsing, error handlers; configure Python 3.8 compatibility.

## Steps
1. Set up Python virtual environment
   - Create virtual environment with Python 3.8
   - Install Flask/FastAPI and required dependencies
   - Create requirements.txt file

2. Create basic application structure
   - Create app entry point (app.py or main.py)
   - Set up application configuration
   - Create modules directory structure (routes, models, services)

3. Implement core components
   - Set up routing framework
   - Create error handling middleware
   - Implement request validation
   - Set up logging

4. Configure development server
   - Set up development server with hot reload
   - Configure CORS for frontend development

## Human Verification Checkpoints
- [ ] Virtual environment is created and dependencies are installed
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] Basic routes (e.g., health check) are responding correctly
- [ ] Error handling works as expected
- [ ] Project structure follows best practices for the chosen framework

## Dependencies
- Task B (Project skeleton should be defined)

## Estimated Time
- 3-4 hours
