# WireGuard Gateway UI Project Tasks

This directory contains detailed task breakdowns for the WireGuard Gateway UI project. Each task includes specific steps, human verification checkpoints, dependencies, and estimated time requirements.

## Task Structure

Each task file follows this structure:
- **Description**: Brief overview of the task
- **Steps**: Detailed breakdown of implementation steps
- **Human Verification Checkpoints**: Specific items to check to ensure the task is complete and working correctly
- **Dependencies**: Other tasks that must be completed first
- **Estimated Time**: Approximate time required to complete the task

## Task Workflow

The tasks follow a general progression from setup to deployment:
1. Initial setup (A-B)
2. Backend implementation (C-N)
3. Frontend implementation (O-T)
4. Testing and quality assurance (U-X)
5. Documentation and deployment (Y-Z)

## Human Interaction Checkpoints
