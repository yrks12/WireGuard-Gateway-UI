# WireGuard Gateway UI - Fix Plan Status

## Completed Fixes ‚úÖ

### Fix #3 + #4 (Combined): False Disconnect Alerts & Database Readonly Errors
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED & DEPLOYED
- **Branch**: `fix/false-positive-disconnect-alert` (merged to main)
- **Root Cause**: Peers without recent handshakes were falsely marked as disconnected + SQLAlchemy session corruption
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed default peer status to True when found in `wg show` output
  - Increased disconnect threshold from 5 to 30 minutes  
  - Added "Now" handshake handling
  - Implemented retry logic with rollback for database operations
- **Result**: Reduced false alerts from 480+ per hour to 0

### Fix #2: Email Settings Lost on Reinstall
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED & DEPLOYED  
- **Branch**: `fix/email-settings-lost-on-reinstall` (merged to main)
- **Root Cause**: `install.sh` recreates database, losing email settings
- **Solution**:
  - Created backup/restore script for email settings
  - Modified install.sh to backup before DB deletion and restore after
  - Added startup loading of email settings from database
  - Fixed virtual environment path issue (`env` ‚Üí `venv`)
- **Result**: Email settings now persist across reinstalls

### Fix #5: Timestamp Mismatch UI vs Logs  
- **Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETED & READY FOR DEPLOYMENT
- **Branch**: `fix/timestamp-mismatch-ui-vs-logs` (committed 54fd923)
- **Completed**:
  - ‚úÖ UTC formatter for all application logs
  - ‚úÖ Template filter for UTC display  
  - ‚úÖ Monitoring logs now show UTC timestamps
  - ‚úÖ Dashboard Recent Activity fixed (latest commit)
  - ‚úÖ Client Testing handshake display fixed (latest commit)
  - ‚úÖ **NEW**: Recent Activity API fully functional with last_activated/last_deactivated tracking
  - ‚úÖ **NEW**: Connection Status shows real handshake times instead of "Never"
  - ‚úÖ **NEW**: All templates standardized to UTC format (formatTimestampUTC function added)
  - ‚úÖ **NEW**: Database timestamp storage unified to UTC across all operations

## Pending Fixes üîÑ

### Fix #1: Client Name Lost on Subnet Prompt (PRIORITY: LOW)
- **Status**: ‚ùå NOT STARTED
- **Branch**: `fix/client-name-lost-on-subnet` (created but no implementation)
- **Root Cause**: When user fixes subnet, original client name is lost
- **Priority**: Low - cosmetic issue only

## Architecture Issues Identified üîç

### Dual Database System
The codebase uses **two separate database systems** which complicates timestamp management:
- **Config Storage** (`/instance/configs.db`): SQLite with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` (local time)
- **Flask ORM** (`/instance/app.db`): Uses `datetime.utcnow()` (proper UTC)

### Missing Activity Tracking
Recent Activity feature is fundamentally broken:
- API expects `last_activated`/`last_deactivated` fields that don't exist
- Client activation/deactivation events are not timestamped
- Would need schema changes and route updates to fix properly

## Next Steps for Tomorrow üìã

1. **Immediate Priority**: Complete Fix #5 timestamp standardization
   - Fix all remaining `toLocaleString()` uses in templates
   - Address the Connection Status "Never" issue
   - Test deployment to ensure fixes work in production

2. **Medium Priority**: Decide on Recent Activity fix approach
   - Option A: Add missing fields to config storage (requires schema change)
   - Option B: Remove Recent Activity feature temporarily
   - Option C: Use test history data as substitute

3. **Low Priority**: Implement Fix #1 if time allows

## Deployment Notes üöÄ

- **Production Location**: `/opt/wireguard-gateway/`
- **Deployment Command**: `sudo ./install.sh --skip-dependencies`
- **Never use**: `systemctl restart` (doesn't apply development changes)
- **Always verify**: Check logs at `http://172.17.246.210:5000/monitoring/logs` after deployment

## Technical Debt üìù

- Main routes file (`app/routes/main.py`) still needs refactoring (1006 lines)
- Empty files need cleanup (`check_users.py`)
- Incomplete development todos in `REMEBER.txt`
- Dual database system creates complexity and inconsistency
